    <pre>1.2. <b><u>LOCATION</u></b></pre>
    <pre>1.2.1. 3kms from Bheemunipatnam on the Beach Road for Bheemunipatnam to Visakhapatnam</pre>
   <pre>1.3 <b><u>Introduction</u></b>:</pre>
    <p>1.3.1. The Society, immediately, on its registration on 29-05-1970 initiated action to develop a layout, on a medium scale, on the sea front in the vicinity of Bheemunipatnam primarily with twin landable objectives. Firstly to provide an impetus to the efforts to arrest the deterioration of the town and a fillup to its economic growth. Secondly, it planned to ease the housing pressure on the fast growing Visakhapatnam town, at that time.</p>

    <p>1.3.2. Accordingly, it applied on 02-07-1970 to the then District Collector to allot about 400 Acres of land to the Society in the vicinity of Bheemunipatnam with a sea front (Annexure – 1.1).</p>

    <p>1.3.3. The District authorities examined this application for more than 7 long years by referring the case to the then Revenue Board, the urban development authority, Visakhapatnam and other concerned governmental agencies. Finally, the then District Collector decided to allot the required land at Rs. 500/- per acre near Bheemunipatnam with the sea front in Survey No. 49 of Nerellavalasa Village in Nidigattu Panchayat of Bheemunipatnam Mandalam, a poramboke land not fit for cultivation with huge sand dunes and asked the Society to gives its consent vide Rc No. 276/76 dated 03-03-1977 (Annexure – 1.2).</p>

    <p>1.3.4. The Society accepted this offer and gave its consent. Even before the transaction finalized, the Indian Navy, as understood, demanded this land for its proposal to build a naval establishment, named as INS Kalinga, to store certain missiles. The Government conceded to this request and allotted to this land to Indian Navy vide G.O. No. 95 dated 21-01-1985 (Annexure – 1.3).</p>

    <p>1.3.5. While allotting this land to the Indian Navy, the Andhra Pradesh Government asked the Society to ask for an alternative site vide G. No. 674 dated 18-04-1983 (Annexure – 1.4). The Society indicated a site in the same survey no. to the North of the land allotted to INS Kalinga.</p>

    <p>1.3.6. Accordingly, the then District Collector decided to allot about 400 Acres of land to the Society in the same survey no and numbering it as 49/1 vide proceeding of the District Collector (vide Annexure-1.5) @ Rs. 1,000/- per acre, provisionally and directed the then Tahsildar to deliver the land to the Society. The Society took delivery of this land on 29-02-1980 vide delivery challana Rc No. 1082/79-B-3 (Annexure – 1.6). Thereon, the Society asked the members to remit the land cost on an assured basis vide (Annexure – 1.7).</p>

    <p>1.3.7. On measurement it worked out to 373 Acres 94 cents and the Society deposited the provisional land cost of Rs. 3.74 lakhs in the Government treasury vide challana No. 200 dated 08-06-1984 (Annexure – 1.8). The Society, then, applied for issue of the Title Deed to the land to the then District Collector through the then Tahsildar. It was forwarded to the then District Collector. Even before it could be perused and the Title Deed secured, the Government replaced the elected Managing Committee of the Co-operative Societies in the State by Government nominated committees. These committees totally neglected this aspect even though they were Government agencies and particularly in case of this Society its Chairman, initially, was a Joint Collector from the IAS cadre.</p>

    <p>1.3.8. A very unfortunate event which costed substantially the Society and consumed as many as 28 valuable years to secure the Title Deed. At the same time, this Joint Collector as Chairman of the Society sought contributions from the members of the Society at Rs. 5,000/- each vide circular No. 10/84-85 dated 28-01-1985 (Annexure – 1.9) and wasted almost about Rs. 80 lakhs by awarding a work contract to another governmental agency viz the Andhra Pradesh Agro Industries Ltd for the levelling the site which was completely wasted out due to improper planning of the levelling work.</p>

    <p>1.3.9. An elected Managing Committee was installed in 1990 and this committee under the Presidentship of Shri. M. Arunachalam and its Secretary Shri. D.G.K. Raju took up the threads and endeavoured to set right the course for the Society. This committee prepared a layout plan and submitted it to the VUDA. The VUDA rejected the application for approval of the layout on the ground that there was no Title Deed furnished and objected to the development work undertaken by the Society without the approval of the VUDA. In view of this, the Society filed a writ petition No. 1327/ 1992 in the Andhra Pradesh High court against the VUDA. The High Court gave an interim judgement dated 28-01-1992 (Annexure – 1.10) restraining both parties from further action and directing then to maintain the 'Status Quo'. meanwhile, the Society approached the then District Collector to give the Title Deed to the land and obtained a certificate from the then Mandal Revenue Officer vide D. Dis. 287/91 dated 31-08-1991 (Annexure – 1.11).</p>
